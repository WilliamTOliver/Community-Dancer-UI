# Community Dancer UI

## Intro
This is both a repository for a portfolio project and in it's structure (commits, readme, and changelog) instructions on how to construct a React/TypeScript UI.

To learn how to build a project like this, start in either the commits (broad strokes in commit messages + isolated code change diffs) or change log (detailed descriptions of changes)

This is paired with Community Dancer API which serves the same purpose (portfolio piece + instruction) but for a Express/TypeScript + Postgres/TypeORM REST API.
